# TUNOCENT Data

This repository contains the data collected by the research project *Tunisiaâ€™s Linguistic terra incognita: An Investigation into the Arabic Varieties of Northwestern and Central Tunisia (TUNOCENT)*, led by Veronika Ritt-Benmioum at the University of Vienna, Department for Near Eastern Studies, in cooperation with the [Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH)](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. 

The project aimed at the collection, documentation and analysis of dialectal varieties in the northwestern and central Tunisian governorates and makes use of the technical framework of VICAV, the *Vienna Corpus of Arabic Varieties*. For more information please consult the main installation of VICAV at <https://vicav.acdh.oeaw.ac.at>. 

This repository contains the following types of data: 

* **Place Profiles** These are short descriptions of the locations where data has been collected (in `vicav_profiles`). 
* **Feature Lists** Questionnaires which help systematically compare the linguistic features of the various Tunesian varieties (in `vicav_features`)
* **Sample texts** translatios of a standard text into the varieties under investigation (in `vicav_samples`)
* **Corpus texts** Transcribed narratives, ethnographic texts and conversations (in `vicav_corpus`)

Moreover, the file `corpus.xml` contains metadata on all audio recordings which have been collected during the project and from which the above mentioned data has been derived.

Please find more information on the project and a user-friendly interface to use this data under <https://tunocent.acdh.oeaw.ac.at>.
