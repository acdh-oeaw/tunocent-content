                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>Though it is a well-known fact that one of the most distinctive features between urban and Bedouin-type Tunisian dialects is gender distinction in verbs and pronouns - with the urban ones showing no dinstinction, and the Bedouin ones retaining it - there is no detailed comprehensive study on this morphological variable which would include all available data for Tunisian Arabic dialects. Our knowledge remains to a large degree dependent on Marçais’ 1950 publication which was taken up by other scholars like Singer (1984), and on Gibson’s sociolinguistic studies which he conducted mainly with students in France and England (Gibson 1996, 1998, 2002, 2012). In his tentative classification of Tunisian dialects, Marçais (1950) further claims a differentiation within Bedouin dialects resulting in an S (for Sulaym) and an H (for Hilal) group. Some representatives of the former are supposed to show gender distinction not only with verbs and the independent pronoun but also with suffixed pronouns and even in the plural, whereas the latter do, according to Marçais’ short description, neither differentiate between m. and f. in the plural nor in the singular for suffixes.
Based on this information and on publications on various Tunisian dialects (mainly of the sedentary type like Tunis, Sousse, and Takrouna) we will try to challenge these general remarks and strive to complete or re-arrange Marçais’ picture by making use of our TUNOCENT-data from about a hundred locations within seven Tunisian governorates where mainly dialects of the Bedouin type are spoken. Thereby we will consider the following aspects of gender distinction:
	Gender dinstinction in the second person singular of verbs in perfect and imperfect 
	Gender distinction in the independent and suffixed pronoun of the second person singular 
	Gender distinction in verbs and pronouns in the plural
	Gender distinction in suffixes attached to various particles, most of all the particles hā and ṛā, the interrogative šbī and the negation marker miš. 
Newly or almost published studies for the dialects investigated within the TUNOCENT-project (Abdelfattah &amp; Ritt-Benmimoun 2022, Ritt-Benmimoun in print) have their focus on the gender dinstinction of verbs in the 2nd p.sg. and brought to light that some dialects in the North, mainly those of Beja and Teboursouk, do not differentiate between m. and f. In many places in Sidi Bouzid speakers do differentiate between m. and f. in the perfect but not in the imperfect. Our current study should complement these interesting findings by focusing also on pronouns and particles. 
Due to the large area covered by our research our contribution will mainly be an areal-linguistic one though to a certain extent also socio-linguistic factors, especially the age of the speakers, will be of relevance as well.<lb/>

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>This paper investigates the impact the prestigious dialect of Tunis has on the dialects spoken in Northwestern, Central and Southwestern Tunisia. The variables to be considered in our study are (1) the use of [q] versus [g], (2) the realisation of the personal pronoun of the 1st person singular, (3) the plural of III-weak verbs (e.g. yžī and yansa) and (4) the loss of gender distinction in verbs. Our research questions touch both diatopic and diastratic issues. We want to investigate (1) if all of the seven governorates show the same or similar developments regarding the four investigated variables, (2) special developments within an area and their possible reasons, (3) the role of age, gender and level of education. 
The data that underlie our analysis were gathered in various field-work trips by methodical inquiry into salient linguistic features and by elicitation of linguistic data in the seven Tunisian governorates of Jendouba, Beja, Kef, Siliana, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa. Our investigation is based on approximately 190 speakers from about 90 different locations.

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>This paper treats the remarkable variation concerning pronominal suffixes in the hitherto undocumented Northwest Tunisian Bedouin Arabic variety of the Nefza region. Regarding the third person singular suffix, the variants -ah ~ -a ~ -ahᵃ ~ -u are used. It is unusual that an Arabic variety uses both -ah and -u. In the Bedouin variety of Nefza -ah is the original suffix used by all speakers, whereas -u is a new variant, limited to speakers with a certain sociolinguistic background. The second variation examined in the paper is about the second person plural suffixes -kum ~ -kim as well as the third person plural suffixes -hum ~ -him. In the case of these two pronominal suffixes, two factors seem to influence the variation found in Nefza Arabic: the origin of the speakers as well as the phonetic environment. The data show that the i-variants (-kim and -him) are extensively used in the speech of the rural population, and to a lesser extent in the town of Nefza. As for the second factor, it is particularly true for the 3PL suffix, in which the i-variant -him is triggered by a preceding -ī-, whereas -hum is the prevalently used variant after other vowels.

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>Some of the earliest voice recordings of Arabic made for linguistic purposes date from World War I and were made by German authorities who recorded prisoners of war in the Halbmondlager camp outside of Berlin. This study analyzes two voice records in particular, which are labelled ‘Tripolitanisch-Arabisch (Tunesien)’ and stem from what is now southern Tunisia. This study seeks to historicise the scientific context of these voice records as well as interpret the linguistic data preserved by them in the light of Arabic dialectology. It also raises questions about the reliability of both voice recordings and printed linguistic data from the time.

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>This PhD thesis provides a comprehensive description of the phonology and morphology of the hitherto undescribed Arabic variety spoken in the Northwest Tunisian Nefza region, with a selection of transcribed and translated texts attached. The linguistic corpus of ~ 50,000 words is based on data collected during three field research stays in the Nefza region within the scope of the TUNOCENT project, which examines the hitherto undescribed Northwest and Central Tunisian Bedouin type Arabic varieties. The data, consisting of both questionnaires and narrative texts, have been collected in the town of Nefza, as well as in the five surrounding villages Touila, Umm Labid, Zaga, Ouled Bou Ali and Hbeba.
The description includes linguistic variation based on the speaker’s age, gender and origin. Moreover, comparative remarks on geographically adjacent and linguistically cognate Arabic varieties, such as the prestigious sedentary variety of Tunis and the South Tunisian Bedouin type variety of Douz are made.
According to W. Marçais’ (1950) classification of Tunisian Bedouin type Arabic varieties as the so called Sulaym type and Hilāl type varieties, Nefza Arabic should belong to the northern group of Sulaym type varieties. In the final part of this thesis W. Marçais’ Sulaym–Hilāl division of Tunisian Bedouin type varieties is reevaluated by investigating the degree of correspondence of the linguistic features listed by W. Marçais as typical for Sulaym type varieties with actual Nefza Arabic features.<lb/>

It is based on data systematically elicitated between 2019 and 2021 during fieldwork campaigns in more than 90 localities situated in the seven Tunisian governorates of Jendouba, Beja, Kef, Siliana, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa in the realm of the project “Tunisia’s Linguistic terra incognita: An Investigation into the Arabic Varieties of Northwestern and Central Tunisia” (TUNOCENT). The data is presented quantitatively and qualitatively, showing the most wide-spread forms and those the use of which is restricted areal-linguistically to certain regions or socio-linguistically to certain age groups. Comparisons of our findings are drawn to the urban dialect of the capital Tunis (SINGER 1984) and to the Bedouin-type dialect spoken in the region of Douz in southern Tunisia (RITT-BENMIMOUN 2014a). The newly published WAD (BEHNSTEDT &amp; WOIDICH 2021) is used as a comparative tool on a broader diatopic level. Furthermore, the interrogatives are analyzed morphologically with regard to suffixes, and lexically regarding their etymology and grammaticalization pathways.

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>This paper examines the impact of the typological property of morpho-logical richness on diminutive formation in Italian, Austrian German, English,and Tunisian Arabic. It investigates the priority of the pragmatics over the semantics of diminutives in these languages, i.e., of pragmatic meanings such as mitigation, endearment, sympathy, empathy, and irony over smallness and youth. Hypocoristics and quasi-hypocoristics are also dealt with. Diminutive formation in Arabic is root-based, in English word-based, in German and Italian it is both. Morphological richness has an impact on high type/token frequencies (Italian &gt;Arabic &gt; or≈German &gt; English), number of productive diminutive patterns, number of different patterns applying to the same base (if pragmatic, no pattern orlexical blocking, e.g., Italian vipp-ino/-etto/-uccio/-ar-ello), combinations of diminutive suffixes. Italian is the freest language in attributing to diminutives both the head and the non-head property of changing (or not) the gender, and of transforming (or not) adjectives into nouns. English and German turn adjectives into nouns, German also changes gender into neuter, with the exception of (quasi-)hypocoristics and of child-/pet-centered speech. The data analyzed are from Viennese German, Tunisian Arabic, Tuscan Italian, and British English. Our focus is on diminutives in asymmetric communication with pet animals.

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>The town of Testour lies close to the Medjerda river in northwestern Tunisia and it was founded in the 17th century by the Muslim Moriscan community who was exiled from Spain, after the Reconquista led to a rise in Christian zeal in the Iberian peninsula. By making North Africa their new home, the Moriscos introduced their customs, agriculture, architecture, food and dress amongst many other things, to these new towns and to the locals. The inhabitants of Testour today claim that they are the descendants of the Moriscos, and as such as keen to practice typical Moriscan trades, such as producing the chéchia hat and celebrating the Maʔlūf music. This master’s thesis aims at documenting some of the phonological and morphological features of the Arabic dialect of the present community of Testour, on which to my knowledge, no such linguistic works currently exists. The recordings on which this thesis is based have been collected during the framework of the TUNOCENT project hosted by the University of Vienna, which strives to collect and document the dialects of certain towns in northwestern and central Tunisia. The outcome of this thesis is to put Testour on the linguistic map of Tunisia, a country on which relatively very little has been done in this regard, as well as to hopefully contribute a better insight on the ambiguous dialectal classifications in Tunisia.<lb/>

                     <hi rendition="#b">Abstract: </hi>Our paper investigates the relationship between language attitudes and practices in Tunisia, particularly in the two mainly rural governorates of Siliana and Jendouba situated in Northwestern Tunisia. The data that underlie our analysis were gathered in 43 qualitative interviews and through participant observation during fieldwork in spring and summer 2019, and by methodical inquiry into salient linguistic features. First, speakers’ attitudes towards and their evaluation of (1) their own local dialect and (2) the dialect of the capital Tunis reveal that the capital Tunis and coastal towns such as Sousse are perceived as urban and advanced – in education as well as in lifestyle – whereas the central and north-western regions of Tunisia are perceived as rural and culturally backward. We show how speakers apply social meanings to certain linguistic variables such as the use of the urban [q] that is considered as fīnu ‘genteel, refined’ in contrast to the rural [g]. Others, though also clearly urban features, are not equally charged with stereotypes, among them the adoption of the urban personal pronoun of the 1st person sg. ǟna. Second, the impact these evaluations have on speech patterns and consequently on intra-dialectal levelling processes and language change is analysed and its patterns described. We show that language ideologies and attitudes are determined by the intersection of age, gender and level of education, and that young, educated women with a rural background are among the first to adopt urban features. As women in Siliana and Jendouba are expected to act more fīnu than their male peers, they are more inclined to adopt the [q]. The situation of the personal pronoun of the 1st person sg., the plural of III-weak verbs and the loss of gender distinction in verbs, however, is less clear.

The data gathered during the project will be hosted and prepared for longterm preservation at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ACDH-OeAW) with its director Dr Karlheinz Moerth being our national research partner. Within four years and with a team of four collaborators, the project TUNOCENT will provide up-to-date linguistic data for the hitherto almost unknown Arabic varieties spoken in the region approximating the seven Tunisian governorates of Jendouba, Beja, Kef, Siliana, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid, and Gafsa. In 1950 the famous French dialectologist William Marçais affixed the term terra incognita to Tunisian Bedouin-type dialects, differentiating them into what he called the H- (Hilāl) and S- (Sulaym) dialects. His judgement that further research into these almost completely unknown varieties is urgently needed still holds true now, almost 70 years later. Therefore, this project is the first attempt to linguistically illuminate a part of Tunisia which has long remained understudied. Details concerning the collection of the linguistic data through fieldwork will be given, the proceeding and analysis of the data, which will take place in the first years. In the final year of the project, an intra-dialectal comparison will reveal the common traits and differences of Tunisian Bedouin-type dialects and should enable a detailed classification of them.

Within four years, and with a team of four collaborators, it hopes to provide up-to-date linguistic data for the hitherto almost unknown Arabic varieties spoken in the region approximating the seven Tunisian governorates of Jendouba, Beja, Kef, Siliana, Kasserine, Sidi Bouzid, and Gafsa.  
One of our methods during fieldwork involves a short sample text given to the participants at various locations which serve as linguistic points of reference. This text contains linguistically significant words and phrases as well as morphological and morpho-syntactic peculiarities and as such is an ideal means for the comparison of certain linguistic features. Through analysis of almost eighty of these texts recorded in five different governorates we will present an insight into the variation of monophthongised diphthongs, imāla, the distribution of q and g, pausal forms, suffixed pronouns, defective verbs, future markers, and lexical peculiarities.<lb/>

This paper investigates diminutives and hypocoristics used in asymmetric verbal communication with pet animals in three European languages and a Semitic language. Italian, German, English, and Tunisian Arabic display different structural and communicative richness of diminutives, as well as dissimilar customs and sociocultural norms. The paper focusses on pragmatic meanings and functions, including the usages where pragmatic functions are supplemented by semantic meanings. Our data were collected by parallel semi-formal interviews of native speakers of the four languages investigated in order to test our hypotheses that different cultural environments exploit the pragmatic potentials of hypocoristics and diminutive forms in different ways when addressing pet animals or speaking about them. Diminutives are often used with pets in analogy to child-directed speech, mainly to express empathy and in familiar contexts.<lb/>
